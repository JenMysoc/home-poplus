It's been a while since our last chat so we've had a lot to update on. 

The biggest news for [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org) is that we're due to launch [SayIt](http://poplus.org/posts/sayit/) next week. Keep your eyes peeled for emails, tweets and other information surrounding the launch!

There's been quite a bit of work done on [PopIt](http://poplus.org/posts/popit/) and we're hoping to make a start on some pagination soon. 

[Ciudadano Inteligente](http://www.ciudadanointeligente.org/) have also made a start on their parliamentary monitoring site which is currently running [BillIt](http://poplus.org/posts/billit/)(our first use case!) and will also be running [WriteIt](http://poplus.org/posts/writeit/). The dev team have been discussing a [VotaInteligente](http://votainteligente.cl/) site for Morocco and some potential [WriteIt](http://poplus.org/posts/writeit/) uses there as well.
