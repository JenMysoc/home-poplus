# Poplus’ first award

Last week, we received the gratifying news that Poplus has been recognised in the [Nominet Trust 100](http://socialtech.org.uk/nominet-trust-100/).

[The Nominet Trust](http://www.nominettrust.org.uk) is the UK’s largest social tech funder, and the NT100 celebrates those who are using digital technology to change the world for the better. 

[Here’s our page on the NT100 website](http://socialtech.org.uk/projects/poplus/) - but do have a browse of the other 99 winners: we’re honoured to have been recognised alongside so many worthy people and organisations in the world of digital technology and social innovation.
