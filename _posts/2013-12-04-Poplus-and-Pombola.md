Today we had a hangout with the [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org) and [Ciudadano Inteligente](http://www.ciudadanointeligente.org) developers to discuss the next development steps for [PopIt](http://popit.mysociety.org/). 

[PopIt](http://popit.mysociety.org/) now has a hidden fields option, to stop personal data being shared, and we're working on a [resolver](https://github.com/mysociety/popit-resolver) next.

[Ciudadano Inteligente](http://www.ciudadanointeligente.org) are going to be using the [Pombola](https://github.com/mysociety/pombola) code for their next project so we discussed what the code can, and can't, do. [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org) are working on an info site for this soon!

And finally we've agreed to use [prose.io](http://prose.io) to edit the Poplus site!
