SayIt is a component for storing structured speech information, including debates, speeches, or dialogues. It can act both as a standalone site for hosting, or as a Django app embedded within another project. 

It has been designed to make publishing politicians' speeches, court records or any other transcript attractive, easily searchable, painless and as quick as possible. 

[SayIt](http://sayit.mysociety.org) is now in Alpha and can be used to publish transcripts already in the [Akoma Ntoso format](http://sayit.mysociety.org/about/akoma-ntoso). The second stage of development will cover the ability to directly author new transcripts through a web-based user interface.
