Do you have an idea for a new Poplus Component? Or would you like to add features to an [existing one](http://poplus.org/components/current/)?

We're currently inviting groups and individuals to apply for grants. You may apply for up to USD $5,000 to help you with development work on creating or improving a Poplus Component.

* Priority will be given to proposals for the development of new Poplus Components, or new features for existing Components.
* We will also consider grants for those planning to implement existing Poplus Components into wider projects.
	
## How to apply ##
Please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1s0vJ2tDugRhqc74HQ39kmQpQ8noK8WF3R-wLFbyfToE/viewform) before 10th September 2014.

We hope to inform successful applicants by 17th September. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:hello@mysociety.org).

## Help us fund more projects ##
This funding will be the final expenditure from the original Poplus start-up grant.

If you represent a funding organisation, and might be interested in helping support the growth of Poplus through funding micro-grants, please do let us know! 

Poplus Components represent great 'bang for your buck', since they are re-usable across the entire eDemocracy worldwide community.
