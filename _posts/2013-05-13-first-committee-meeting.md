The first Poplus committee meeting will take place, via Skype, on Thursday 15th May at midday UTC ([see what time that is where you are](http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2014&mo=5&d=15&h=12&mn=0)).
Everyone is welcome to join us as we discuss how to drive Poplus forward for the next twelve months. If you'd like to join in, please add your name and contact details to this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NU2tBeTye8rgStwLv4QoAaZdg6sGpbp9Y9LwnaoSQ6Y/edit#gid=0), and stand by to join the call on Thursday.

Don't worry if you can't make it; we'll be reporting back on the decisions that are made.
