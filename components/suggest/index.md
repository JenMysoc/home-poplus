##Got an idea for a new Poplus Component?

Whether you have the capability to build it yourself, or you have a great idea but no technical skills, we want to hear your ideas for new Poplus Components.

##Add to our Trello board

Trello is where we collect and prioritise ideas for new Components. You'll see all current ideas on the [Poplus Trello board](https://trello.com/b/5gGF4xrJ/ideas-for-new-poplus-components).

###To add a new idea

* You'll need a Trello account. If you haven't got one, click the big green "sign up for free" button.
* Read the existing cards to make sure your idea isn't already there (if it is, you can add comments and register a vote to help it rise in priority).
* If your idea hasn't already been added, click on the card named "Ideas? add them as a comment in this card".
* Write a comment, describing your idea. One of the team will review it and create a new card for it.

That's it! But if you really want your idea to become a reality, you can do more.

###If you're a coder

You'll probably want to write the code yourself. But it makes sense to discuss it with [the community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) first, so that:
* you can make sure you're not duplicating an idea that's already been developed;
* people can make suggestions for improvements or features that they'd love to see;
* you can tap into the knowledge and experience of many other developers;
* you can talk to others and ensure that your Component will work with different forms of government and within different countries.


###If you're not a coder

Then your job will be to inspire the developers in the Poplus community enough that they want to help build your Component!

Make a post on [the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus), telling people all about your idea  and asking for feedback - and see if anyone would have an interest in building it. You can also ask people to upvote your idea on the Trello board.

Remember, Poplus members are volunteers, and usually have day-jobs as well as their work here - so there are no guarantees. But great ideas will usually get attention.
