Right now, Poplus is still being formed. It consists of nothing more that the people who think it is a good idea, and are willing to put in time and effort to ensure that it happens.

We welcome everyone who is interested in helping, and there are a number of ways in which you can do so.


#How you can help Poplus
##Join a committee

We have divided the current workload between a number of committees. These groups meet online (via Skype, Google Hangouts or other convenient technologies) at regular intervals, to discuss and divide up the work that needs to be done.

Committee membership is open to anyone, anywhere in the world. Just check our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) to find out when the next meeting of you chosen committee will be, and come along. 

If you can't make it, don't worry - the agenda will be on a shared document that is open for your comments.

##Current committees

###Governance
Poplus won’t succeed if it doesn’t have a plan, and enthusiastic people who want to see that plan become reality. 

That’s what the governance committee is for - it’s a group of people from different countries and organisations who are working together to make Poplus really work. Right now, they are working on an action plan for the next twelve months.

###Events
This group will be working together to run Poplus meet-ups, conferences and talks, and also to make sure that we are represented at existing events.

We particularly welcome people from any country who are happy to go and talk about Poplus at conferences or meet-ups.

###Components
The Components group will offer support in the creation and use of Poplus Components, and will also work towards the creation of a certification standard. 

Their duties will include overseeing / helping with scoping and technical documentation of Poplus Components, as well as giving technical support to anyone who needs it.

###Communications
The Communications group will be setting a strategy for outreach to potential members and member organisations. They'll also look after our website and social media, and there's a plan to make sure that members share their stories and experiences for the benefit of everyone. 

If you have translation skills, this group want to hear from you, too!

###Finance
Every organisation has its financial issues, and Poplus is no different. 

The Finance group will be looking at issues such as obtaining funding grants, which jurisdiction we should be registered in, and how best to oversee our funds.

##Other ways to get involved

You don't have to join a committee to be part of the Poplus Federation. Here are some other valuable ways to get involved.

###Write stories
People in the Poplus community have expressed a desire to hear stories from others who are trying to use digital technologies to empower citizens, open governments and get things changed.
You can help Poplus by sharing your experiences. You can write them in any language; and even better, you or other Poplus members can translate your stories so that everyone can benefit from them.

###Organise Poplus events (or take Poplus to other events)

Poplus started at [PoplusCon](/popluscon/) in Santiago, Chile, in May 2014.

In order for people to come together to share stories, technology and lessons we will need to have more events, in more places.

So you can help by either helping to organise an event about Poplus, or by going to an existing event and telling people about Poplus. Just don’t forget to join the [Poplus mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) and tell other people what you have planned!

###Write code

If you’re a coder, there are lots of ways you can get involved.

You can learn about Poplus Components, try them out, and give feedback to the people who are building them. Or you can contribute directly to the development of current Poplus Components, or build new ones. Read about [what a Poplus component is](/components/), and learn about the ones that [already exist](/components/#components).

But Poplus is not just for people who want to use Poplus Components - it’s for anyone who thinks there is value in sharing lessons relating to technologies for citizens. So if you already run a civic or democratic tech project, and you want to be connected to Poplus, just join the mailing list and tell us a bit about yourself, your project, and what you’re trying to do next.

###Design

Help us make Poplus look elegant, and communicate effectively. If you have design skills, our developers will be very happy to meet you. Just [drop us a line](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus).
