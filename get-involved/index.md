Right now, Poplus is nothing more than the people who think it is a good idea. That means there’s no contribution too small to matter, and no skillset that we won’t embrace.


##How you can help Poplus
###Join the governance committee

Poplus won’t succeed if it doesn’t have a plan, and enthusiastic people who want to see that plan become reality. That’s what the governance committee is for - it’s a group of people from different countries and organisations who are working together to make Poplus really work.

Anyone, from anywhere in the world, can volunteer to be part of the Poplus committee - the only thing you need to be a member is a willingness to show up and help out. Meetings are conducted online. Find out more here.

###Write stories
People in the Poplus community have expressed a desire to hear stories from others who are trying to use digital technologies to empower citizens, open governments and get things changed.
You can help Poplus by sharing your experiences. You can write them in any language; and even better, you or other Poplus members can translate your stories so that everyone can benefit from them.

###Organise Poplus events (or take Poplus to other events)

Poplus started at PoplusCon in Santiago, Chile, in May 2014.

In order for people to come together to share stories, technology and lessons we will need to have more events, in more places.

So you can help by either helping to organise an event about Poplus, or by going to an existing event and telling people about Poplus. Just don’t forget to join the Poplus mailing list and tell other people what you have planned!

###Write code

If you’re a coder, there are lots of ways you can get involved.

You can learn about Poplus Components, try them out, and give feedback to the people who are building them. Or you can contribute directly to the development of current Poplus Components, or build new ones. You can read about what a Poplus Component is here, and learn about the ones that already exist here.

But Poplus is not just for people who want to use Poplus Components - it’s for anyone who thinks there is value in sharing lessons relating to technologies for citizens. So if you already run a civic or democratic tech project, and you want to be connected to Poplus, just join the mailing list and tell us a bit about yourself, your project, and what you’re trying to do next.

###Translate

Poplus is all about crossing the barriers made by language and by distance. If you can speak more than one language, and you’re willing to help you can help by:
Translating documents about Poplus - like, for example, this page you’re reading now!
Translating the words used within Poplus Components, so that these pieces of software are easier to re-use in more places.

Please let us know if you have the language skills to do this.

###Design

Help us make Poplus look elegant, and communicate effectively. If you have design skills, our developers will be very happy to meet you. Just drop us a line.
