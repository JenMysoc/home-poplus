# What is Poplus?

Poplus is an international community of activists, citizens and developers. 

Together we are creating standardised, internationalised, interoperable, open-source Components, to make it easier to build websites that empower citizens, no matter where you are based.

## Our Founding Principles

1. We believe technology can empower organized citizens to pursue social change.
2. We believe that the best technology solutions come out of collaboration.
3. We believe that key technology solutions should be easy to replicate, no matter where in the world you are or what language you speak.
4. We believe that robust technological solutions can be cheap, easy, and quick, rather than expensive, difficult, and time-consuming.

## How this Works.

You have a vision that would make your country's democracy more accessible for everyone. You’ve seen sites like [TheyWorkForYou.com](http://theyworkforyou.com/) or [VotaInteligente.cl](http://votainteligente.cl/) and would like to build a similar site that monitors your Parliament. It would provide information about all the representatives, and publish everything they say or vote on. 

Thanks to your website, people would be far better informed about what goes on in Parliament, and better able to make fact-based decisions.

But websites like that require a lot of coding, and take a long time (and a lot of money) to build and maintain. Because of this, many people either give up, or settle for a site that does a small fraction of what they would create if they had a much bigger budget.

Ideally, we'd love to be able to provide you with a website ‘out of the box’, which you could put your country's data into, and use right away. Sadly, the world isn’t like that. Legislatures are all very different, and it’s impossible to provide a system that can be used in every country.

Or... is it? When you look carefully, you see that, no matter how different they are, all Parliaments consist of many of the same elements:

+ _People_ hold _positions_ (e.g. the Minister of Education or a Member of Congress)
+ Each _person_ is usually the member of a _party_ or holds some affiliation
+ Each _person_ can make _speeches_ about topics and _vote_ on bills
+ _People_ are often related to a _jurisdiction_ or _constituency_ that has boundaries

Now it might seem easy enough to create a database of people, and cross-reference it with a database of positions, but in fact, it's harder than you'd think.

+ Politicians sometimes change party
+ They often change position
+ Sometimes they change their name — perhaps when they get married

In each case it’s not enough to simply update your database — you need to accurately display the correct historic version when showing what they did in the past. And these are just some of the _predictable_ issues. Invariably, there are always _unpredictable_ ones, too, which can cause headaches when they first arise months or even years after your site launches. (We’ve been running sites like this for over ten years now, and have learned lots of this the hard way!)

With all this in mind, we’ve developed Poplus Components — pieces of software that take all these problems into consideration, so that you don't have to worry about them. You can use just one, or you can put them all together - they're designed to interoperate.

Poplus isn't just about parliamentary monitoring websites, though. We're applying the same formula to every kind of civic or democratic website, from sites for reporting potholes, to sites which let you request information from those in power.


## Community

You can participate in Poplus as a Supporter or a Contributor.


#### 1) Supporters
Supporters may simply be people who happily use the Poplus Components to make their lives easier. But we’re also including anyone who commits to celebrating and endorsing the idea of using shared technology for empowerment across multiple countries.


#### 2) Contributors
Contributors are those who contribute to the Poplus Ecosystem — perhaps by creating a new Component, adding features to existing ones, or providing technical support. 

##### How do I become a contributor?

We're still working on this right now but check back in a couple of days and we'll have updated this!


## Technology


Our technological solution was born from the failure that our founding organisations faced in the implementation of new deployments of different applications in also different contexts (different countries, different cultures, different laws). Implementation of new websites and apps had become increasingly expensive, as each deployment required to 'reinvent the wheel' and re-write the code, adapting to each particular context. In order to avoid this problem, we took a more sustainable approach, which is to promote the development of websites from a component-based approach. This means that a websites must not be acknowledged as a whole, but as a group of different components that serve different and specific functionalities. In Poplus we develop generic components based on Rest API's, so that future websites may choose to use one, two or several components, based on the functional needs that need to be satisfied.

## The Objectives


1. Poplus will reduce the cost and time of citizen driven tech efforts, encourage collective action and collaboration among users.

2. As a result of the latter, with Poplus we expect to see more citizen driven tools during the first years of implementation, as well as more citizen-tech organizations that due to Poplus can get easily up and running. 

3. Due to the generic nature of Poplus modules (using rest APIs), they should go beyond the perimeter of transparency and participation apps that originally motivated the development of these generic modules. Hence, Poplus will also foster the development of apps for issues that are as diverse as extraction of natural resources, poverty, aid, public budgets, crisis management, etc.

4. Because Poplus provides the basic app infrastructure, we expect to see further innovation in citizen app development, which can expand on top of existing components (no need to spend time to get the basic infrastructure right). Thanks to a proper documentation, Poplus aims to achieve a positive learning curve among its community. 

5. To see tech collaboration in the development and use of generic modules is only the first stage of a broader effort that in future iterations could include collaboration in the policy and advocacy front. Hence, organizations that attempt to control corruption may not only develop transparency platforms based in common components, but they may also extend collaboration of accountability efforts from other non-tech grounds. For example, a corrupt organization that is legally based in the US., but which operates in Chile and has impact in Kenya, could eventually be hold accountable by coordinated organizations in each of the three countries.
