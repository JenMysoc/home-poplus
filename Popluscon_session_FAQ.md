## Propose a session

At PoplusCon, we'll be shaping the future of the *Poplus collaborative civic coding project*. By the end of the conference, we hope that all kinds of groups will be using, creating or collaborating on Poplus tools.

Sessions at PoplusCon will be proposed and facilitated by you, the participants. If you want to contribute to the conference agenda, check the selection criteria below, and complete [this form][form].

mySociety and Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente will select a small number of the final sessions before the conference.  On both days of the conference, a minimum of a third of the slots will be kept open so that attendees can propose sessions. We’ll do this in the morning and will have a board and post-it notes where people can put their ideas and vote on ideas. There will also be lightning talks both days, of a maximum of 5 minutes per talk. Anyone can sign up for one of these and there’s going to be about 10 slots per day.


Separately from the sessions we'll create a space where people can collaborate to work on components, sites that use components, data standards or anything practical. 

**We hope useful *connections* will form between technical and non technical groups.**
**We hope that you'll come away with a new *enthusiasm* for community-driven development.**
**We hope that the *tools* proposed will be developed further, taken up and used - because they fulfill a real need.** 



### Session Length
We'll be running up to three sessions in parallel, so attendees can pick and choose which topics suit them best. 

Sessions should be around **30-40 minutes long** and can be in any style or format provided that everyone attending can get involved - we won’t select proposals that are simply panel discussions where only the panel speaks, for example.

We’re aware there is not much time to submit sessions. But we know you’ll come up with some great ideas no matter what. We look forward to reading your submissions.

### How sessions are selected

If you’re submitting a proposal, the key questions we’ll be using to select the programme sessions are:

+ Would the session help other groups be more effective - through application of technology, campaigning or advocacy - in their field of operation?
+ Would the session help advance the Poplus network in some way? This could be through discussions on scope, focus, new components, how to network effectively across countries or similar ideas.
+ Would the session allow participants to engage with the idea, debate and dispute it?
+ Would the session offer PoplusCon participants a concrete, valuable outcome?

What mySociety and Ciudadano Inteligente would love the conference to achieve is the creation of a group of people that feel like a network. A network that feels like anyone could ask for help and get it, that is inspired to build platforms using tools its members and others are creating. A network that wants to contribute back to Poplus because it's useful to them, both for tools and for collaborations. When pre-selecting the small number of sessions, we'll favour proposals that will make this happen! 

We hope you feel the same way and want to use these ideas to select sessions on the day as well.

### Examples of Potential Sessions

Here are a couple of general examples of the type of sessions that might to be of interest to the conference attendees.

#### Data for Parliamentary Monitoring
How do I convert my Parliamentary Data into formats that let me reuse all the existing components?  What are the challenges of this?  How have other people overcome these challenges? Or for example How do I model my Parliament's bill process to reuse BillIt? 


#### Running projects effectively across different countries
If you have a tech team in one country and an activist team in another (or within the same country, but geographically separated), or two or more tech teams (with same proviso) collaborating on one component, What are the challenges? How do you overcome them? What are the best ways to work together - Skype, face-to-face, hangouts? What experiences can you share? How can you make the best decisions about whom to work with? 

#### A new component
You’ve got an idea for a great new component and you want to get feedback on it from the other interested parties in Poplus to help you refine and develop the concept. What do people think of the idea? How could it be used in different countries and contexts? How will it work with other poplus components? Can it also work as a standalone piece of tech? What are the main features it will have and what need is it solving? Is there an initial example issue that could be used to shape the features of the component?
